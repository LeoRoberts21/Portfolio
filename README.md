# Leo Roberts Portfolio

Building my first portfolio website in the hopes of landing a role in web design / development. The site will include a home page, about page, and a seperate page for each of my projects.

## Project Status

Finished, but will continue updating with new projects.

## Reflection

This was a side project that I built to be able to demonstrate both my design skills and my new found interest in coding.

I wanted to build a site that looked minimal with the projects taking centre stage. I wanted to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project took me longer than I thought it would, and I overcame some new challenges I hadn't faced. I realised coding for mobile first and then making it responsive to bigger screens is way easier. I also learnt more about specific sizing values and where to use them (though I still used the wrong ones in many places).
